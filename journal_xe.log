░░ Subject: systemd-udev-settle.service is deprecated.
░░ Defined-By: systemd
░░ Support: http://www.ubuntu.com/support
░░ 
░░ Usage of the systemd service unit systemd-udev-settle.service is deprecated. It
░░ inserts artificial delays into the boot process without providing the
░░ guarantees other subsystems traditionally assumed it provides. Relying on this
░░ service is racy, and it is generally a bug to make use of it and depend on it.
░░ 
░░ Traditionally, this service's job was to wait until all devices a system
░░ possesses have been fully probed and initialized, delaying boot until this
░░ phase is completed. However, today's systems and hardware generally don't work
░░ this way anymore, hardware today may show up any time and take any time to be
░░ probed and initialized. Thus, in the general case, it's no longer possible to
░░ correctly delay boot until "all devices" have been processed, as it is not
░░ clear what "all devices" means and when they have been found. This is in
░░ particular the case if USB hardware or network-attached hardware is used.
░░ 
░░ Modern software that requires some specific hardware (such as a network device
░░ or block device) to operate should only wait for the specific devices it needs
░░ to show up, and otherwise operate asynchronously initializing devices as they
░░ appear during boot and during runtime without delaying the boot process.
░░ 
░░ It is a defect of the software in question if it doesn't work this way, and
░░ still pulls systemd-udev-settle.service into the boot process.
░░ 
░░ Please file a bug report against the following units, with a request for it to
░░ be updated to operate in a hotplug fashion without depending on
░░ systemd-udev-settle.service:
